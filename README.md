# Feedback App

This is a small React app to show reviews for a service. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Installation
run `npm install` from your terminal
To install all dependencies

run `npm run dev` to run the project
This is because a script was created to run the mock database and the application at the same time


## Database
The app is current using [json-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server) to mock a server which serves the data from db.json within the app. Future update will include the use of a cloud database service such as MongoDB Atlas
